**Big Data Analytics Case Study**

**DepEd Enrolment Data Dashboarding**

**March 2025**


**Situation**

The Department of Education (DepEd) recently underwent a change of administration. This means that its management is keen on understanding the current state of the Philippine education system. This requires an inventory of key indicators that the agency has been collecting– one of which is the annual enrollment data.

The current system (Learner Information System) allows the agency to gather and manage information about students, which are critical in developing and planning education programs and policies. Unfortunately, the system lacks the ability to provide a real-time dashboard for DepEd employees to use. The current process is still manual, where the Education Management Information System Division, the owner and user of the system, would only generate data upon the request of other DepEd offices or external partners (i.e., NGOs, research companies, Universities, etc.). This is not the ideal state because in order to create relevant and effective solutions for challenges in the Philippine education system, policymakers should have access to accurate, reliable, and real-time data.

**Goal and Role**

To address this, the DepEd management would like to engage with analytics professionals who will streamline data workflow of the agency from collection, repository, analysis, and application. Below are the goals of the project:

- Create a data workflow map for the Learner Information System
- Build a data dictionary of DepEd enrollment data based on the generated dataset.
- Develop a data dashboard for DepEd personnel that allows them to have a glance of DepEd’s topline enrollment data and manipulate data (through filters and different cuts) for education programs and policy planning.

You are a team of eight (8) analytics professionals tasked to work on this project. Each of you will assume a certain role: the Analytics Project Manager shall serve as the overall lead for the project; the Data Scientist(s) shall evaluate and analyze variables for the analysis; Data Engineer(s) shall develop the architecture of the dashboard to ensure that data is accurate and reliable throughout the data pipeline; Data Analyst(s) shall provide assistance to the Data Scientist in preparing and analyzing data. They shall also serve as the first line of defense by cleaning and preprocessing the data, working closely with the Data Engineer.

**Audience**

You will present your final work alongside a comprehensive documentation to the following DepEd officials: Chief of the Education Management Information System Division, Director of Planning Service, and the Undersecretary for Strategic Management. They will determine the feasibility of adopting your work into the day-to-day operations of the agency. This means that beyond the management, your work has to be accepted by the end-users– technical staff of DepEd.

**Performance Standard**

The following parameters shall serve as guide in producing a quality output for this case study:

- Did the project have a clear purpose? And did it satisfy the needs of its clients?
- Has the team identified and co-develop key performance indicators based on the set goals?
- Is the data aggregated reliable and free from inconsistency? 
- Does the dashboard employ effective and engaging visualization? Is the layout logical and easy to follow? Does it feature filters or drill-downs to enhance user engagement and exploration?
- Does the dashboard tell a story and offer actionable insights for its target users?
